            The Smiths were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. The group consisted 
            of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke, and drummer Mike 
            Joyce. Based on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on 
            a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and post-punk, were a 
            rejection of the synthesiser-based dance-pop of the time.

        <h2>Personal Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                My introduction to The Smiths was a live performance by frontman Morrissey at Firefly 
                music festival in Dover, DE as the opener for Paul McCartney. I had never heard of his 
                former band and was intrigued by the show. It wasn't until a few years later that I even 
                learned what The Smiths were and after that they remained a staple on my spotify library. 
                Their music covers a wide breadth of human emotions and I find myself relistening to 
                their albums in all different periods of life.
